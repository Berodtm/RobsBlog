          <h2>Tic-Tac-Toe Game</h2>
          <p>I followed a guide on Youtube and I particularly enjoyed learning the JavaScript side where we selected win conditions using arrays.</p>
          <p>You can see the game <a target="_blank" href="https://berodtm.github.io/codecademy-projects/CodeWithAniaKub%C3%B3w/tikTacToe/">here on GitHub</a></p>
          <p>It might sound daft but I also discovered I can have an Index.html in any folder, this linked page doesnt have the html name at the end. I thought that was pretty cool.</p>

          <h2>Random Quote Generator</h2>
          <p>I had a blast learning about API for the first time on Youtube. There was a bit of Bootstrap, A bit of Font Awesome icons and a bit of J-Query. The guide was really old and a lot of the code didnt work anymore, this made me go onto the bootstrap site and find replacement classes.</p>

              <h2>Magic 8-Ball</h2>
              <p>One of the first cool projects I completed on Codecademy was to use a switch statment in JavaScript to see a random question in the console.</p> 
              <p>Once happy with the JavaScript I applied some stuff I learnt about the DOM and turned it into a webpage. I did a bit of sloppy CSS trying to make a round ball, its not responsive and looks kind of quirky. I kind of like it and will keep it like that to remind myself how far I've come when reading back.
